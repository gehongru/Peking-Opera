Here are the main parts of this model that are included:

Data preprocessing: load and transform the image dataset, resized to 512x512. 

CLIP model: text-guided image generation using the CLIP model, which optimises the generated results by the similarity between text and image coding. 

Attention-enhanced U-Net model: a multi-head attention U-Net model is implemented to improve the detail and consistency of the generated images. 

High Contrast Noise Generation: A high contrast noise generator increases the contrast between the bright and dark regions of an image to generate images that are more consistent with the features of Peking Opera faces. 

Stable Diffusion Model: Adds noise through forward diffusion and denoises through backward diffusion to generate high quality images. 

LoRA fine-tuning: Reduces computational requirements and speeds up the training process through low-rank fine-tuning. 

This model architecture will generate high-quality images of Peking Opera faces, and also supports customisation of the generated image styles through text prompts.
